  I am currently writing this at 4:46 am. Submission ends in literally 4 hours, and presentations start in 6. My partner and I had no energy drinks, no sleep, no help; we survived solely on sheer willpower.

MediMate is an AI-powered health companion that utilizes the Google Gemini API, designed to streamline communication between patients and healthcare professionals. It consists of four key components:
1. Medical & Family History Input: A dedicated space for users to record their prior medical conditions, treatments, allergies, and family health history.

2. Daily Health Logs: A simple, intuitive journal for users to log daily symptoms, pain levels, concerns, and overall well-being.

3. Your Health Companion (AI Chatbot): A conversational assistant that allows users to ask health-related questions. It references the user's history and logs to provide evidence-based responses without diagnosing, acting instead as a easily accessible health consultation resource.

4. Summarized Health Reports: The AI can generate a comprehensive report focused on a user-specified health issue, compiling relevant calendar logs based on reported symptoms for easier communication with your healthcare provider.
